    details:                The iPod Touch (stylized and marketed as iPod touch) is a multi-purpose pocket computer designed and marketed by Apple Inc with a touchscreen-based user interface. It can be used as a music and video player, digital camera, handheld game console, and personal digital assistant.[8] It connects to the internet through Wi-Fi base stations and is therefore not a smartphone, though its design and operating system are very similar to Apple's iPhone. As of May 2013, 100 million iPod Touch units have been sold.

                            The iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. It runs Apple's iOS mobile operating system.[15] The first generation iPhone was released on June 29, 2007;[16] the most recent iPhones, the seventh-generation iPhone 5C and iPhone 5S, were introduced on September 10, 2013.
                            The user interface is built around the device's multi-touch screen, including a virtual keyboard. The iPhone has Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity (2G, 3G, 4G, and LTE). An iPhone can shoot video (though this was not a standard feature until the iPhone 3GS), take photos, play music, send and receive email, browse the web, send texts, and receive visual voicemail. Other functions — video games, reference works, GPS navigation, social networking, etc. — can be enabled by downloading application programs (‘apps’); as of October 2013, the App Store offered more than 1 million apps by Apple and third parties.
